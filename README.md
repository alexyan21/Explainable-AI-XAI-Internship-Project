**Project: Development and Evaluation of Explainable AI Models Using SimMachines XAI Platform**

During my internship at simMachines, I contributed to a comprehensive Explainable AI (XAI) research project evaluating the company’s proprietary explainability tools (SimCluster+, SimClassify) in comparison with open-source tools such as LIME and scikit-learn’s clustering methods.

My responsibilities included:

- Running predictive models (XGBoost) on the HELOC credit dataset and generating feature explanations using both LIME and SimMachines Workbench.

- Creating technical reports comparing explanation consistency, monotonicity, and feature importance using visual tools (HDBSCAN + t-SNE).

- Benchmarking SimCluster+ against sklearn clustering models (e.g., KMeans), evaluating performance using F1 scores, silhouette scores, and runtime.

- Generating visualizations for internal analysis and public-facing fact sheets used by the marketing team, demonstrating my ability to translate technical insights into accessible formats.

- This experience significantly deepened my understanding of model interpretability, algorithm benchmarking, and how explainability is critical in regulated, high-stakes industries like healthcare and finance. Portions of my work are documented and reproducible via my GitHub repository.
